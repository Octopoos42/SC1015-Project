## Problem Definition

- What is the relationship between total number of graduates and wages in the context of productivity?
- How does productivity contribute to this relationship?

## Aim
- To investigate the relationship between total number of graduates, productivity and wages, and to determine if there is a causal relationship between these variables.

## Model Used

1. Linear Regression

## Conclusion

- Model 1: Strong linear correlation between Predictor and Predictand
- Model 2: Strong linear correlation between Predictor and Mediator
- Model 3: Strong linear correlation between Predictor, Mediator and Predictand
- Leave-one-out Cross Validation has proven to help produce accurate and precise prediciton models

## What did we learn from this project?

- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Leave-One-Out Cross Validation
- Linear Interpolation from pandas
- Mediation Analysis
- Collaborating using GitHub
