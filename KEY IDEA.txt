MOTIVATION:
SEE IF THERE IS ANY GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN WAGES

FINDING:
PREDICT GENDER'S WAGES, COMPARE TO ACTUAL WAGES

SEE IF GENDER AFFECTS WAGES

-> IS TRUE ( HIGH CORR )

I BELIEVE THAT IS NOT THE REAL REASON

-> INTRODUCE PROD

WHEN PROD IS INTRODUCED, RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENDER AND WAGES BECOME WEAK

GENDER->PRODUCTIVITY->WAGES ( PROVEN )

PREDICT WAGES USING THIS RELATIONSHIP
